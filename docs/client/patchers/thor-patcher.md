# Thor Patcher

Thor Patcher is designed with the client-side config file embed *inside* the patcher itself.
Since it uses no extra DLLs, you may distribute 1 file to your players. This guide will not discuss how to
setup a [Web Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server).

# Features

- Pack into single/multi grf file \[0x200\]
- Automatically generate GRF if not exists
- RGZ support
- Customizable skin
- Multilingual base on user's OS region setting
- Background music
- No extra dll, not even config file is needed when distribute \[No conflict with other server\]
- Embed config file and resource data (images for background/buttons)
- Custom Buttons \[Hard limit \>2 billion, soft limit non-existence as in 2.6.2.68\]
- Remote config file
- Self update and client update \[Supports multi client exe update(Up to 255)\]

# Files

1.  Patcher folder contents:
    - **Thor.exe** (*Patcher's executable file*)
2.  Tools folder contents:
    - **ConfigEmbeder.exe** (*used to add your config to the patcher exe*)
    - **CheckSum.exe** (*used to generate a CRC32 sum of the patcher and client exe*)
    - **ThorGenerator.exe** (*used to make patches*)
    - Sample skin files
    - sample **config.ini**
    - sample **language.ini**
3.  Web folder contents:
    - a sample **notice.html**
    - a sample **main.ini**

# Setup

To set up your thor patcher, you need to go through the following steps:

- make a skin
- write a config.ini
- write a language.ini (optional)
- pack the config & skin into the patcher exe
- write a main.ini
- write a notice webpage
- upload the main.ini & the notice to your webserver

## Making a Skin

A Thor Patcher skin is divided into following parts:

1.  **Background** (*This is the main part of a skin*)
    - supported formats
      - jpg (no transparency)
      - bmp (the very top-left pixel is used for transparency)
      - partial transparency (.png) is not supported yet
2.  **Buttons**
    - System Buttons:
      - The typical buttons you see on every patcher:
      - Start : starts the main client
      - Cancel : cancels the update process
      - Close : closes thor patcher
    - Custom Buttons:

      
    see [guide](#custom-buttons)
3.  **Custom Notice Box**:
      
    see [guide](#custom-notice-box)
4.  **Progressbar** (*Shows the patching progress*)
    - Supported formats when use image based progress bar
      - bmp
      - jpg (crashes on 2.6.1.66)
      - png (crashes on 2.6.1.66)
5.  **Status message** (*Displays the patcher status*)

  
  
You can change the size and the position of every element of the patcher, so there are almost no limits to what you can
do - be creative. The easiest way to make a skin is to make a single photoshop file with layers for each part of the
skin.

# Writing the Config

Config.ini contains the following lines:

## \[Config:Main\]

- RootURL='http://domain.com/patch/'
  - The URL where you plan to store all data related to thor patcher.

    Don't forget to change it in your config too.
- FinishOnConnectionFailure=false
  - The user can only exit if the patch fails and the setting is set to false. If set to true, the user can continue to

# Packing the Config Into the Patcher

Make sure the following files are in the same folder before proceeding:

- config.ini
- language.ini (optional)
- Skin Files
- ConfigPacker.exe

Now, we are going to pack the config into the patcher.

- Start ConfigPacker
- Select your copy of Thor.exe by clicking "browse"
- Press "Combine"

# Writing the main.ini

## \[Main\]

- allow=true
  - Allow patching or not.
- Force_Start=false
- policy_msg=

<!-- -->

- file_url=http://domain.com/patch/data/
  - the URL where you plan to save your patches in
    - supports both HTTP and FTP
      - HTTP: use the following format:
        - http://domain.com/dir/
      - FTP :
        - connecting as anonymous:
          - ftp://domain.com/dir/
        - connecting with user & pass:
          - ftp://username:password@domain.com:port/dir/
          - username is required if you want to use a password
          - if you don't specify the port, the default one will be used

## \[Patch\]

- ClientSum=
- PatcherSum=
  - Can be obtained from CheckSum tool.

<!-- -->

- ClientPath=
- PatcherPath=
  - Filename of patch file when update patcher/client. These files should store in the place with other patch files.

<!-- -->

- PatchList=plist.txt
  - Patch list file.

# Writing the Notice Page

The archive includes a sample notice.html, but you can use other formats like .php, .asp etc. By doing so, you also need
change notice_file in **config.ini**.

If for example, you would like a feed exported from your "News and Announcements" sub-forum (or variations thereof), you
could easily include a small snippet of php on the page to echo out a few of your latest topics. For example, the
following code would be sufficient to output the latest 5 topics in your notice.php:

```html+php
<?php
	$content = file_get_contents('http://mywebsite.com/forums/index.php?/rss/forums/1-announcements/');
	if ($content) {
		$i = 0;
		$xml = new SimpleXmlElement($content);
		$newsAmount = (int)5;
	}
?>

<?php if(isset($xml) && isset($xml->channel)): ?>
	<?php foreach($xml->channel->item as $rssItem): ?>
		<?php $i++; if($i <= $newsAmount): ?>
		<div style="padding-left: 20px;">
			<span><a href="<?php echo $rssItem->link ?>"><?php echo $rssItem->title ?></a></span>
			<p>
				<?php echo $rssItem->description ?>
				<?php echo date('M j, Y', strtotime($rssItem->pubDate)) ?>
			</p>
			<br />
		</div>
		<?php endif ?>
	<?php endforeach ?>
<?php endif ?>
```

You will need to ensure that the forum topics you are exporting have an RSS feed being output. If not (in the case of
IPB especially) you will need to login to the admin panel and create the export feed manually.

# Patch List

By default, the file containing a list of your uploaded patches is called plist.txt, and is defined in the main.ini file
situated on your web host. Patches should be defined in sequential number like so:

```
...
15 20131106_newclient.thor
16 20131106_GM_Fix.thor
17 20131106_Wings.thor
... etc
```
